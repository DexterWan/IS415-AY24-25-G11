It has lead to the death of over 12,000 Filipinos to date, with at least 2,500 of the deaths attributed to the Philippine National Police.

By observing specific provinces, we can determine if there is significant clustering and potentially pinpoint areas that seem to be targeted by the government for drug-related incidents.\nWe used Spatial Auto-correlation to identify any outliers. Global and Local analysis can help to identify clustering across the whole of Philippines, and using Hot-Cold analysis we can identify outlier provinces.\n\nWe want to see if the killings have truly been reduced under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nWe used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the overall number of cases across from the beginning of 2016 till 30 June 2024. This allows us to see the overall number of cases across time, and allows us to filter out cases based on fatality and the type of cases.\nWe used Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns Analysis to see the pattern of cases from 2016 to 2024. It allows us to identify the movement of cases across the whole of Philippines. With the option to use fixed-ranges, we can also determine if there is an actual shift in the number of cases or just reduction/increasing number of cases in specific areas.\n\nThere are claims that the killings mainly affect the “urban poor”. Can we observe this through evaluating the rate of incidents against each province’s Gross Domestic Product per Capita (GDPPC)?\n\nWe used Linear Regression to determine if there is any correlation. By calculating the incident rate by taking the total number of incidents divided by the population of each individual province, we can identify if incidents are truly tied to a province’s GDPPC."
