When President Rodrigo Duterte took office in Philippines in 2016, a national "war on drugs" was declared and carried out. It has lead to the death of over 12,000 Filipinos to date, with at least 2,500 of the deaths attributed to the Philippine National Police. The Human Rights Watch(HRW) research found evidence of police falsifying evidence to get convictions, leading to unjust killings. (HRW, n.d.)

Now that a new President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has taken office in 2022, he promised to end the killings and focus on rehabilitation. However, killings still seem to be ongoing till the current day (Yan, 2024). In our project, we have 3 main objectives:

1.  We want to find out how the "War on Drugs" was occurring in Philippines, to see if there are any patterns over where most cases took place. We used [**Spatial Point Patterns Analysis**]{.underline} and to identify any clustering of cases and [**Spatial Auto-correlation**]{.underline} to identify any outliers.

2.  We want to see if the killings have truly been reduced under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. We used [**Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns Analysis**]{.underline} to see the pattern of cases from 2016 to 2024.

3.  There are claims that the killings mainly affect the "urban poor". Can we observe this through evaluating the rate of incidents against each province's Gross Domestic Product per Capita? We used [**Linear Regression**]{.underline} to determine if there is any correlation.
